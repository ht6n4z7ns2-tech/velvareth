DEATH_MACHINE_LYRICS = """
This is no exaggeration, we're living in a death machine
And no, it's not just your imagination
You've been living in a death machine
Some of us are passengers, and some of us are driving
Almost everybody's getting bled to death to keep the motor running
I'm not being hyperbolic, this place is a death machine
Literally and symbolic in the belly of the death machine
Doesn't matter who is steering, it's just gonna keep on killing
'Til we find a way to finally break the routine
You might as well face the music
You're living in a death machine
This ain't no call to action, can't get no satisfaction
Not even sure what I was trying to sing
But at least until it stops existing
This fucking time bomb keeps ticking
Shit man, goddamn, that's just obscene
Living in a death machine
In the belly of the death machine
Everybody do the death machine
Living in a death machine
